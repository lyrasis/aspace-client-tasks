ArchivesSpace Client Tasks
==========================

This repo contains a collection of Thor tasks used to get data into shape for ASpace and to interact with the ASpace API via the ruby [archivesspace-client](https://github.com/lyrasis/archivesspace-client)

Some of the tasks contained in this repo are data-specific and not useful for general processing but I'm keeping them here as examples for other projects.

This repo is built to be cloned as a sub-repo of a kiba-extend project. If used as a standalone app, make sure to add a `thorfile` that points to the .thor files.
