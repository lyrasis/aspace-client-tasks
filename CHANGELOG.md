## [2.1.0] - 2023-02-08

### Added

- `common:objects:make_index_aos_dynamic` method
- `common:objects:move_aos_children_to_parents` method
- `common:objects:post_aos_children` method
- `common:objects:post_aos_children_intermediary_grouping` method
- `get_children_of_ao` method
- aos_tester_iterate.rb example template script for catching breaking template issues

### Changed

- Changed all remaining `invoke` method calls to `execute` method calls
- Generalized all of the directory references in the template utility scripts

<!-- ### Deprecated -->

<!-- ### Fixed -->

### Removed

- Removed all `*args` method parameters. This was a janky bandaid for calling `invoke` method calls multiple times within a given context

<!-- ### Security -->

## [2.0.0] - 2022-10-19

### Added

- `get_json` method to read JSON data from file
  - needed since methods now accept data instead of files
- `get_accessions` method
- `get_accessions_all_ids` method
- `delete_accessions` method
- `make_index_accessions` method
- `post_accessions` method
- `turn_on_access_restrictions` method
- `update_accessions` method example
- Mixin module that contains the `execute` method

### Changed

- Refactored `get`, `get_all_ids`, `post`, and `delete` methods for agents
  - Instead of having static methods for each agent type, these methods are now dynamically defined using `define_method`
- Refactored all `post` methods to accept data rather than reading in a file
  - This makes the `post` methods more flexible when chaining methods together
- Added a countdown message for each `delete` and `post` method
- Moved `attach_x` (agents, subjects, classifications) to their respective classes
  - Makes more sense than having these methods in the Objects class since one can attach any of those entities to accessions as well
- Refactored the `chains.thor` examples to use `get_json`
- Changed `aspace_client.rb` log paths to be more reusable in conjuction with kiba-extend projects
- Monkey-patched Thor class to include `mixin` module
  - This replaces all of the `no_commands` blocks previously required in each file

<!-- ### Deprecated -->


### Fixed

- `common:subjects:make_index` now removes the spacing around dashes that ArchivesSpace inserts
  - conforms to common practice for how complex headings are formed
- added condition to `attach_x` methods to ensure the process doesn't override an array if it already exists, adding to it instead

### Removed

- Removed `post_all_agents` method in favor of the chaining capabilities of this app

<!-- ### Security -->
